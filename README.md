# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2024, written in Go.

# Running Solutions

Solutions are registered in `main.go`, which maps a day number to a function for that day. If no day has been registered, `Not implemented!` will be printed.

Ex (from the repo root):

```

go run . 1

===> Part1: 1234
===> Part2: 1234

go run .

===> panic: Please provide a day as a command line argument

go run 35

===> Not implemented!

```
